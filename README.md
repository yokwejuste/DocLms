Welcome to Cameroon and welcome to the doctor learning management system. Our slogan **More than learning, It's a life taste**. 

In answer to the recent pandemic diseases that appear in 2019 (Covid 19), we got the idea of brigning forward a leaning plateform to make the day of students during confinemnt busy. Using mostly google products and their APIs such as [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), [Gooogle Translate](http://translate.google.com/), [Google vision](http://vision.googleapis.com/) we gave birth to our baby (DocLMS). 

## What is DocLMS all about?
I guess you'll skip this LMS saying "Oh an LMS? Nothing new we know that", give me some minutes let me present this product to you and its feature that makes it our pride.

The DocLMS is a product built that makes a perfect mixture of the [Django framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) at the backend and for the frontend is more than just a normal template made of HTML, CSS and javascript. Instead, it is an alliage of different frameworks such as [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/). We are aimed at using [google technologies](https://developers.google.com/products) to get an optimized solution for education.

## The core features
The Doctor LMS is more than a normal LMS. It doesn't only help you by teaching you but also it is aimed at helping you by taking care of your health. Using in-built google machine learning from firebase and google translate APIs, we get closer to our users health, status and get to speak the same language as they do. Below are the core feature we do offer.

- **[Blog](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/blog)**: Getting to know what we do, services we offer and any updates were the reasons why we intergrated a blog to our platform. The blog implementation is an achievement of the linkage between django and firestore. Go and learn of the project from our blog.

- **[LMS](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/)**: The main aim of the platform, the online learning management system built with the django framework and supported by google firebase as backend and authentification framework. This LMS is a no boundary LMS in terms of language spoke, this was achieve by the google translate API to solve the problem of language barier. In Camerooon bilingualism is an idle situation so we're not that way 100% bilingual, some are francophones and others anglophones. 
 
- **[Find my way](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/maps/index/)**: [The university of Bamenda](#) is one of the largest university in Cameroon, and navigating on campus can be a tidous task both for newbies and veterans. This lead to the development of a page where a map of the campus is found with restrcited boundaries just to that campus. The map has all the halls, gates and roads of the campus registered, moving from one point to another easily is like a kid's game. We handle your stay on campus from the 1st to 31st.

- **[The Library Management system](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com)**: In our try to solve our local communoty problems and linking it up to the [UN Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), we noticed the poor management system in our library, will the help of firebase and some machine learning technologies we achieved a simple e-library managemnet system to help our users and mates to get appropriate books for free and ontime. The books are encrypted to be accessed only on the website and download not being possible elsewhere. Access to books are done periodically, by getting a token from the library manager.

## Our impact

Our primary in **django-admin startproject thisproject** was to solve some few goals on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As engineers to be we opted to solve some real life problems. Below are the points which inspired us to give birth to this platform.

Below are the point we targetted on these goals.

1. **[Quality Education](https://sdg-tracker.org/quality-education)** : <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e55088_8510ee57b2cf47239bfe9bf9fe0f2643~mv2.gif" width="100px" height="100px" align="left">The future is education and education is the feature. DocLMS is a learning world where everyone is free of leatning at his/her ease. What's best if it's not to offer an appropriate means of educating the next generation. <br><br><br><br>


2. **[Gender Equality](https://sdg-tracker.org/gender-equality)**: <img src="https://www.aperam.com/sites/default/files/images/E_GIF_05.gif" width="100px" height="100px" align="left"> AS free as DocLMS is, gender equality is one of our happiness. Making user's gender private from both the teachers and their mates gives thesame   education material and quality to people of both sex. Non binaries, Female, Male and Transgender are welcomed and encouraged to our platform. <br><br><br>

3. **[Reduced Inequalities](https://sdg-tracker.org/inequality)**:<img src="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/field/image/e_gif_10.gif" width="100px" height="100px" align="left">
Inequalities existing because of gender, sex, tribe, country, physical disabilities, financial state and origins are restricted and prohibited. At DocLms, we offer eduction for free. We're a free service platform charge.<br><br><br><br>

4. **[No Poverty](https://sdg-tracker.org/no-poverty)**:<img src="https://bumbukucreatives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-no-poverty.gif" width="100px" height="100px" align="left">
The DocLms though being free for all has a source of revenue. Using the google Ads in the feature we will generate income per ads viewed on the website, this money in turn will be used to feed the orphans of our local orphanges. We usually provide bags of rice, spaghetti and some detergents to help them. <br><br><br>

5. **[Good Health and Wellbeing](https://sdg-tracker.org/no-poverty)**:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SDG-3.gif?ssl=1" width="100px" height="100px" align="left">
