Welcome to Cameroon and welcome to the doctor learning management system. Our slogan **More than learning, It's a life taste**. 

In answer to the recent pandemic diseases that appear in 2019 (Covid 19), we got the idea of brigning forward a leaning plateform to make the day of students during confinemnt busy. Using mostly google products and their APIs such as [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), [Gooogle Translate](http://translate.google.com/), [Google vision](http://vision.googleapis.com/) we gave birth to our baby (DocLMS). 

## What is DocLMS all about?
I guess you'll skip this LMS saying "Oh an LMS? Nothing new we know that", give me some minutes let me present this product to you and its feature that makes it our pride.

The DocLMS is a product built that makes a perfect mixture of the [Django framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) at the backend and for the frontend is more than just a normal template made of HTML, CSS and javascript. Instead, it is an alliage of different frameworks such as [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/). We are aimed at using [google technologies](https://developers.google.com/products) to get an optimized solution for education.

## The core features
The Doctor LMS is more than a normal LMS. It doesn't only help you by teaching you but also it is aimed at helping you by taking care of your health. Using in-built google machine learning from firebase and google translate APIs, we get closer to our users health, status and get to speak the same language as they do. Below are the core feature we do offer.

- **[Blog](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/blog)**: Getting to know what we do, services we offer and any updates were the reasons why we intergrated a blog to our platform. The blog implementation is an achievement of the linkage between django and firestore. Go and learn of the project from our blog.

- **[LMS](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/)**: The main aim of the platform, the online learning management system built with the django framework and supported by google firebase as backend and authentification framework. This LMS is a no boundary LMS in terms of language spoke, this was achieve by the google translate API to solve the problem of language barier. In Camerooon bilingualism is an idle situation so we're not that way 100% bilingual, some are francophones and others anglophones. 
 
- **[Find my way](https://doc-lms.herokuapp.com/maps/index/)**: [The university of Bamenda](#) is one of the largest university in Cameroon, and navigating on campus can be a tidous task both for newbies and veterans. This lead to the development of a page where a map of the campus is found with restrcited boundaries just to that campus. The map has all the halls, gates and roads of the campus registered, moving from one point to another easily is like a kid's game. We handle your stay on campus from the 1st to 31st.
